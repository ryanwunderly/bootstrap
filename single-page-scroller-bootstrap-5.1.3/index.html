                        <p class="lead">So far the 2022-23 NFL season has been very unpredictible and very exciting to watch. Teams like the Bills and Cheifs were expected to be good coming into the season by most people and are showing people why they deserve the praise they get, and teams like the Jets, Giants and Seahawks suprised everyone this season playing exceptionally well. Both the Eagles and Vikings are sitting confortably atop the NFC at 8-1. The AFC is going to be a tighter race with the Cheifs on top at 7-2 and many teams like the Dolphins and Titans are one win away from that top seed. The reigning Super Bowl Champs Rams are struggling at 3-6, last in the NFC West. Some teams like the Chargers have been plauged by injuries this season and are looking to get healthier and make a run a run for the playoffs.    </p>

                        <p class="lead">I believe the Los Angeles Chargers are the biggest Dark horse team this year. This whole team was plagued by injuries at the start of the season and they are slowly getting healthier. This team is 5-4 currently with a big game against the Chiefs on Sunday Night, if they can win this game a lot of heads will turn and this team will be back on track. Its looking like star QB Justin Herbert will get both of his star wide receivers back for this game as he has been without his top 2 options for the past few weeks. Herbert alone has been able to keep this team afloat being injured with fractured rib cartilage and with no help from his recieving core because of injuries. This offense has been without their number 1 route running wide reciever Keenan Allen, big play jumpball wide reciever Mike Williams, and speedy downfield wde reciever threat in Jaylen Guyton. Soon star pass rusher Joey Bosa will be off IR to contribute to this defense playing with Khalil Mack to bring back one of the scariest pash rushing duos in the NFL getting the defense back to being feared by opposing offesnses. With Keenan and Mike back Herbert can be unleashed and this offense can go back to making big time plays and winning big time games.</p>
